# Workers KV

{{<description>}}
A global, low-latency, key-value data storage solution. 
{{</description>}}

{{<plan type="paid">}}

Workers KV supports exceptionally high read volumes with low latency, making it possible to build highly dynamic APIs and websites that respond as quickly as a cached static file would. 

With Workers KV, reads are periodically revalidated in the background, and requests which are not in cache and need to hit the centralized back end can see high latencies.
